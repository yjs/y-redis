# Run the server as follows:
# docker run -p 3002:3002 --env-file ./.env y-redis npm run start:server

# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
# FROM node:20-alpine
FROM node:lts-alpine3.19

# Install glibc compatibility for alpine
# See more at https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Running_glibc_programs
